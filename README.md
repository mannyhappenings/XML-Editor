XML-Editor
==========

A html-javascript GUI XML editor

To test it, just download the three files:
1. index.htm
2. script.js
3. style.js

### Usage
After downloading the files, keep them in one folder.

1. Open index.htm.
2. Select a XML file from your filesystem.
3. The XML file will be loaded on your browser.
4. After the file is displayed in the browser, try editing by using the context menu or dbl clicking.

Note: This is a XML Editor still in development, so do not expect something great. Cross-Browser code isn't added to it so try to use on latest Mozilla Firefox (tested on Firefox 31.0) if doesn't work on some other browser.
